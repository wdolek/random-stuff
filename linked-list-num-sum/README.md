## Sum of numbers represented by linked-list

Node of linked-list can contain only one digit out of number (range 0..9).
The goal is to sum two numbers represented by linked-list.

Example:
const a = 100; // linked-list: 1 -> 0 -> 0
const b = 99; // linked-list: 9 -> 9

result should be: 199, linked-list: 1 -> 9 -> 9
