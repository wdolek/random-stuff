## String reverse

Goals:
- reverse word, from "word" to "drow"
- reverse words in sentence, from "this is a table" to "siht si a elbat"

String reversal happens on place without allocating any other array (so yes,
we want to mutate original data).

Things to care about - just don't get lost in indexes, it's pretty damn easy
to lose track where you are :)
